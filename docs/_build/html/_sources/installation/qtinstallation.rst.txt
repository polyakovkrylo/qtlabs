================

.. note::
  Installation will use approx. 1.47GiB of disk space.

1. Go to `Qt download page <https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development>`_\
and download Qt by picking open source version.

2. After downloading installer run it. Linux users need to add permission for \
execution. For that, right click on file -> Properties -> set flag on \
'is executable', than it should become executable.
