Toolkit
========

Qt toolkit includes different tools for development, such as:

#. **Qt Creator** - IDE for development, debugging and deployment of application
#. **Qt Designer** - part of Qt Creator, tool for graphical design of UI
#. **Qt Linguist** - tool used for internationalization of application.

Mainly, every Qt project can be easily build and deployed without these tools by
using different IDEs or editors, but I would encourage you to try out Qt Creator
cause it is nicely tuned for Qt projects.
