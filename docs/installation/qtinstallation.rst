Qt installation
================

Let's first start with installation of Qt and proceed with trying it out by
creating a simple hello world project:

#. Go to `Qt download page <https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development>`_ and download Qt by picking open source version.
#. After downloading installer run it. Linux users need to add permission for execution. For that, right click on file -> Properties -> set flag on 'is executable', than it should become executable.
#. You can skip creating a Qt account or, obviously, create one.
#. Later on selecting components page pick the latest version of Qt (5.9.1 at the moment) and Tools.
#. Install it!
